Task 1: Use hyperlinks in a creative/artistic context

You can create a mini-website that redirects in an infinite loop, or write a poem using hyperlinks, or create an archive for resources, or an interactive text-based game, or feel free to explore more creative potentials of hyperlinks. Think about how we can use hyperlinks as a tool for expression.

Final idea: I will write a song using hyperlinks
